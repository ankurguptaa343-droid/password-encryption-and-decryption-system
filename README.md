A simple password protection system demonstrating secure thinking using cipher–decipher techniques, including user registration, encrypted password storage, and login verification.
## Password Encryption and Decryption System

This project demonstrates a simple password protection system that
uses cipher–decipher techniques to securely handle user passwords.

### Features
- Password encryption before storage
- Encrypted password comparison during login
- Demonstrates secure thinking principles

### Security Note
This project is for educational purposes. In real-world systems,
passwords should be hashed with salting.
